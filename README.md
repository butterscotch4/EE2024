# EE2024
Main Project Description: Advances in sensors and related technologies has enabled us to monitor various quantities in a cost effective way. For our EE2024 assignment, we explore the possibility of deploying one embedded unit for the care of a elderly person in a home setting. We shall refer to this system as Care Unit for The Elderly, known as CUTE. We can imagine such devices being used in each household and the data being sent to an agency known as Centralized Elderly Monitoring System (CEMS) which aims to proactively take action to ensure safe ageing. In this assignment, it is assumed that the base board is a larger prototype version of CUTE, with several output devices to help in the debugging during development. The XBee RF module is assumed to a be a low powered wireless communication device that sends collected data to CEMS.
